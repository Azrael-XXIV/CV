                    As a technical support engineer, Nicole worked closely with the customers from North America to
                    troubleshoot JavaScript, Representational State Transfer (REST), Simple Object Access Protocol
                    (SOAP), Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), and Java database connectivity (JDBC) concerns. On top of
                    the two and a half-month training she received from her company, the nature of her position also
                    made her knowledgeable about the basic processes of accounting.
